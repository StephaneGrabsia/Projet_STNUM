## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

food <- fread("en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csv", nrows = 100000)

food_sans_na <- food %>%
  select(product_name, `energy-kcal_100g`, proteins_100g, sugars_100g, fat_100g, `saturated-fat_100g`, fiber_100g, nutriscore_grade, nutriscore_score, salt_100g, sodium_100g, `vitamin-a_100g`, calcium_100g, `vitamin-c_100g`) %>%
  drop_na()

dim(food_sans_na)
write.csv2(food_sans_na, "data_project.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
