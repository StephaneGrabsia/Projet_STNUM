## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("data_project.csv", sep = ";")
print(data)

data_of_interest = data[c(3:5)]

data_of_interest$energy.kcal_100g <- strtoi(data_of_interest$energy.kcal_100g)
print(data_of_interest)

hist(data_of_interest$energy.kcal_100g,freq=FALSE,xlab="Energy in kcal for 100g",main="Histogramme")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
